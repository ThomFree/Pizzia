                                    <p>If you are here, it's probably because you are doing the <b>Zia project</b> by Epitech, that's good, the aim of <b>Pizzia</b> is to give you a <b>simple</b> and <b>coherent</b> way to build it by proposing you to respect and implement and API applying to your HTP modules.</p>
                                    <p>Thanks to Pizzia, you will be able to build <b>easily</b> and <b>quickly</b> your ZIA architecture by following our <b>explanations</b> and <b>diagrams</b> as well as achieving your different modules in a <b>clear</b> and <b>playful</b> way.</p>
                                    <p>Throughout your project, <b>we are commited</b> to answer any questions <b>related to the  API</b> or <b>related to your architecture design</b> by following the API philosophy, besides we are also commited to help you (as far as possible) to <b>implement</b> Pizzia's API.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, you have the possibility <b>to contribute to Pizzia</b> (we would be very pleased to take in count your changes) and <b>to discuss with us</b> about something that does not please you on our API (i.e. a design choice, a function name),we think we could continuously improving ourselves and thus we are always open to dialog. To do so, we invite you to visit our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page to find out how to participate to our project.</p>

                                    <p>Our API philosophy can hold in brief: <b>simplicity</b>. Our goal is to provide an API with a <b>high abstraction level</b> to ensure that your modules could be writen in a most concise way.</p><p> Similarly to what <b>UNIX</b> says, <i>(write programs that do one thing and do it well)</i> we want to allow you to build modules that perform one unique task in a way to dispatch the process complexity of a web server in different modules.</p><p>Pizzia takes in consideration and respect the <b>RFC2616</b> from various perspectives (function names for example) in order to offer an universally understable API.</p>

                                <h2 class="section-title">Our Architecture</h2>
                                <div class="section-block">
                                    <p>In order to instill the <b>Pizzia's API</b> philosophy, we will (without going into detail) present you a web server architecture with its different modules implementing Pizzia.</p><p> First of all, start to think <b>high level</b> to get Pizzia's operation. We won't talk about <b>socket</b>, nor <b>threads</b> as examples, because <b>Pizzia</b> won't impose you any constraint on how building <b>low level</b> things on your web server.</p> <p>We could sum up (in a synthetic way) an HTTP request made by your brower to a web server with the following diagram:</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GPbIAFB.png" /><p>Indeed, we can see <b>the client (your web browser)</b> sending <b>an HTTP request</b> to the <b>web server (Apache, NGINX or your Zia)</b>.<br /> This request contains a bunch of informations <b>(asked resource, method, headers, content ...)</b> that will allow the server to <b>understand</b> the request to <b>treat</b> afterwards, then resend a </b>response in return</b> that also contains bunch of informations <b>(response status, headers, content ...)</b> allowing the web browser to display it to the final user.</p><p>So we quickly understand our web server job lies in the fact of <b>receive a request</b> then perform the n√©cessary treatment in order to build <b>the response</b>. Well, it's precisely what <b>Pizzia</b> want you to think on how to construct your modules. So let's continue on our diagram:</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DDAGPzA.png" /> <p>As you might have guessed, the different <b>modules</b> that were added on our diagram are in fact <b>modules implementing Pizzia's API</b> !</p> <p>To make it simple, a module is an object implementing the <b>Pizzia::IModule</b> interface. That will receive <b>an object containinf the request</b> that implements <b>Pizzia::IRequest</b> interface as well as an <b>object containing the response</b> that implements the <b>Pizzia::IResponse</b> interface. From there, the module will properly work, it will be able to modify the request or the response in order to make the next module available etc.</p><p>This is called a module <b>pipeline executing modules one by one (with a priority order)</b> relieving the <b>request</b> and the <b>response</b>, modified or not.</p><p>Let's sum up the <b>request execution flow</b> with the pipeline execution with modules we showed earlier: </p><ul><li>First of all, the <b>web serveur</b> will receive the <b>request</b> (some low level): it will receive a <b>socket</b> and read its content. In our case, our web server is a <b>HTTPS</b> server, the read datas on the <b>socket</b> are ciphered. It will build an <b>object contaning an empty response (filled by the modules)</b> and an <b>object containing the raw and the ciphered request</b> (that can be changed by the modules). It will then call the <b>first pipeline module</b> by sending the two objects.</li><br />
                                    <li>The first module: <b>SSL_decrypt</b> will decipher the request content, so it will <b>modify the object containing the request</b> so that this one contains the <b>decrypted</b> request, however it will not change the response. This module only take action on the request, its goal is <b>precise and simple</b>: <b>decipher it</b>.</li><br />
                                    <li>The second module: <b>PHP</b> will take care of <b>executing the PHP scirpt</b> associate to the asked resource. Through CGU, it will <b>transmit the request</b> (gracefully decipher by the last module) to PHP that will <b>interpret the script</b>, the response from the PHP interpreter will be used <b>to modify the object containing the resoonse</b> (so far empty)</li><br /><li>The third module, <b>compression module</b> will simply be in charge of <b>compressing</b> the response content. It will first read the <b>request headers</b> in order to determine if the client <b>is able to decompress the response</b>.If so, it will <b>modify the response</b> (that was already modified before by the <b>PHP</b> module) in order to <b>compress it.</b></li><br /><li>The fourth and last module: <b>SSL_encrypt</b> will make the oposite action tothe first module (SSL_decrypt), it will simply <b>decipher the response</b> (just compressed by the last module). This one <b>doesn't take care of request datas</b>, it will only <b>modify the response</b>.</li><br />
                                    <li>Last, the <b>pipeline execution</b> is done: we have now an <b>object containing the reponse filled by the modules</b>. All that's left is <b>to write the response raw datas</b> on a <b>socket</b> to transmit it to the web browser !</li></ul><hr /><p>If you understood all of that, good news: <b>you understood the Pizzia's philosophy</b> and all of <b>the underlying architecure</b>.</p> <p>We sumed up from a <b>synthetic</b> way the operation of our API, but the <b>principle is really simple to assimilate</b>: we just have <b>chaining modules</b> in order to <b>manipulate the request/response</b>.</p> <p>Every module <b>can modify, if needed, the request</b> (so that the other modules executing afterwards can access to that modified request) as well as the reponse (for the last sending in particular, or for the following modules). When this <b>chain of modules is done</b>, the <b>response is sent to the client</b> (the last module has the hand on the response, as well as the first can completely modify the request).</p><p>Finally, this guide is <b>synthetic and aiming to be light</b> (we voluntarily ommited to write lines of code) to make you <b>understand the operation and the philosophy</b> of Pizzia. We wrote a <a href="#">technical guide</a> with code and instructions to implement yourself <b>Pizzia</b> for your Zia, this guide <b>very handsome</b> aims to make you <b>understand in depth</b> the operation of Pizzia.</p><p>We provide you a <a href="#">Doxygen documentation</a> of our API as well as some <a href="#">modules examples</a> implementing <b>Pizzia</b>.</p>

                                    <p>First of all, you need to download tha Pizzia API in order to begin to implement it. You have two solutions: - to directly use our repository on Github by going through the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">submodules system</a> from GIT<br /> - Direct download the last release of our API and then copy/pastein your project.<br /><br />
                                        You have to know that during the project, the API es likely to be changed (after your feedbacks and after your contribution), that's why we advise you the first solution in order to have changes in real time. <br /><br />Nevertheless you can use the second one. We are ommited to communicate on any changes or any new version (by e-mail / Yammer or anything) and also not making any major changes in order to ensure your that you won't have to remake everything. Only small changes, we promise.
