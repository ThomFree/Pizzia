                                    <h3 class="question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What's Pizzia ?</h3>
                                    <div class="answer">Pizzia is an <b>API</b> which allows you to <b>easily make modules</b> for your own Zia. By respecting the rules and principles of Pizzia when you make your modules, you are guaranteed <b>to make something coherent</b>, which provides a <b>high level of abstraction</b> and allows your module to <b>handle only one task</b><br /><br /> This follows the rules of the <i>divide and conquer pattern</i> in order to make it easier for you to <b>complete your HTTP web server</b>. Dividing your web-server into several modules carrying out micro-tasks is essential. Find the remaining of these explanations on the <a href="start.html">quickstart</a>page that we set up for you.</div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="section-block">
                                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Why should I vote for Pizzia during the election ?</h3>
                                        <div class="answer">In order fo you to use Pizzia, we have to be elected. There are many reasons to opt for Pizzia rather than other APIs&nbsp;:<ul>
                                            <li>Pizzia offers a <b>high level of abstraction</b>, allowing you to be extremly productive and fully respect the <b>RFC2616</b></li>
                                            <li>Pizzia is fully documented, you can find it on our repository or website with a lot of diagrams. Like mentionned above, you have at your disposal a <a href="start.html">quickstart</a> page to get impregnated with the philosophy of the API. A <a href="#">fully documented guide</a> which explains how to implement each of the provided interfaces. <a href="#">Examples of pre-made modules</a> that implement our API and finally a <a href="#">Doxygen</a> to find the documentation of each function provided by our API.<br />In short, there's a lot of documentation for you to work with !</li>
                                            <li>Pizzia was made and thought in order to let you follow several <b>design patterns</b>. By implementing our API, you will be able to realize your own web server in the way of a <b>pipeline</b> (managed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern">mediator</a> for exemple).</li>
                                            <li>We offer full support via <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/ILA_wllVCrs-r_-ogoXCBg">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/ILA_wllVCrs-r_-ogoXCBg">Discord</a> (but also IRL ! =D) to help you using the API. If you have issues, we will be happy to exchange with you.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Everyone can freely contribute our API via GitHub, so don't hesitate to become a Pizzia contributor. In order to achieve this, you only need to refer the lowest part of the FAQ.</li>
                                        </ul></div></div>

                                    <div class="answer"> First of all we advice you to read the short <a href="start.html">quickstart</a> in order yo understand <b>the philosphy</b> of Pizzia in less of 5 minutes.<br /> Then, you can pass to the <a href="guide.html">technical guide</a> which will explain you <b>step by step</b> how to implement <b>Pizzia</b>. Once you implement the different <b>interfaces</b> provided by Pizzia, it will be time to make you first modules. <br />You can find <a href="examples.html">examples </a> made by the team in order to help you.<br />At any time, you can find a very usefull <a href="doxygen/">Doxygen of the API</a> while you're working.</div>

                                    <h3 class="question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> How to contribute Pizzia ?</h3>
                                    <div class="answer">It will be a pleasure to receive your contributions to Pizzia, but first of all you must know what type of contribution you want to make:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Minor improvement:</b> For example: a spell check on the docs or the adding of informations on our website... </li>
                                            <li><b>Major improvement:</b> The change of a method's name or the adding of new methods...</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The difference between these two types of improvements are defined by what they involve: a <b>major improvement</b> will involve <b>to notify all the people using our API</b> that a modification has been made and must be updated in their project. So this type of improvement <b>really matters</b> and it will only be approved  if all requirements are respected:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The improvement is justified by a <b>problem of coherence proved</b> about the actual code of Pizzia. For example, if you think one of the methods doesn't respect the <b>RFC2616</b>.</li>
                                            <li>The improvement is justified by a <b>simple and strong explanation</b> when submitting the <b>pull-request</b></li>
                                            <li>The imrovement doesn't have a <b>very hudge impact</b> and <b>doesn't require a consequent change</b> to make for all of the teams using a working Pizzia API</li>
                                            <li>The improvement does not disagree with the <b>philosopy of Pizzia API</b></li>
                                            <li>The improvement may be <b>modified by our team</b> in the case where we want to integrate it in a different way in Pizzia</li>
                                            <li>The improvement is approved by at least <b>four members of the Pizzia team</b> when submitting the pull-request</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br />As you can see, <b> a major improvement</b> must respect <b>some rules</b> to be approved. All these rules have been setup <b>to avoid all groups to continually update their code</b>. We want that all groupe using Pizzia API work in serenity<br /><br />
                                        All <b>minor improvement</b> can be <b>easily justified</b> by an explanation when submitting the <b>pull-request</b> and must be approved by at least <b>two members of the team</b>.
                                        In order to contribute, you must start by <b>forking</b> <a href="https://github.com/ThomFree/Pizzia">our repository</a>. This will allow you to have <b>a copy of our repository</b> on your <b>Github</b> account in order to make the desired change without touching to our <b>primary repository</b>.<br /> Once forked, you can clone it and make <b>a new branch</b>:
                                        <code>git checkout -b the-modification-description</code> <br /><br />Name must be <b>explicit</b> and written in <b>english</b> by using the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase">kebab-case</a> otherwise the improvement will be <b>automatically refused</b>.<br /><br />
                                        Once you made the change on the <b>new branch</b> and that it has been <b>committed</b> and <b>pushed</b> on <b>GitHub</b>, it is time to offer us your change. For that, go to your <b>GitHub URL</b>. You must have a view similar to this one: <br />

                                        You just have to click on <b>Compare & pull request</b>, you will be invited to explain your improvement <b>in english</b>. Please respect all the rules previously explained when <b>submitting the pull-request</b>.<br /><br />
                                        Once your <b>pull-request has been submitted</b> we will analyze it in a delay of <b>48 hours</b>.<br />
                                        In some case we will notify you that we need you to argue about your change. Finally according to all these rules, your pull-request shall be accepted or not by our team. <br />
                                        If you think your <b>pull-request was wrongly refused</b>, we invite you to get in touch with us on <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/ILA_wllVCrs-r_-ogoXCBg">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/ILA_wllVCrs-r_-ogoXCBg">Discord</a>.<br /><br />We invite you to follow <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/2342361-gerez-votre-code-avec-git-et-github/2433731-contribuez-a-des-projets-open-source">this tutorial</a> if you need more details on how to realize an improvement on GitHub.
