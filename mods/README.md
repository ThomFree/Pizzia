# Module examples
Here you will find multiple module implementations.
All the examples are sorted by **difficulty**, and for a better understanding, you should **start by the first one**.

In every module example you will find at the root a *"README.md"*, wich describes the module, what it is used for and the pipeline in wich the module is.
Every module has comments in it for a better understantability.

We wish you a pleasant lecture !!
